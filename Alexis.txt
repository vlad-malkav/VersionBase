1.  How did the sequence of events at the beginning of your game help or hinder your understanding of RPGs?  When the game took hold of you, how well did you understand what you were getting into?

* Never played before
* No example of other players or DMs
* Non-didactic first game book, no "easing"
* First game complicated to learn
* First role : DM
* No setting
* No confidence (result)

* Very comprehensive friends, that didn't hinder me and were available, no pushovers

2.  How would you describe your issues when you started DMing?  Did you understand the game at the time, or would you say you were just a step ahead of your players.  Has this improved, and if so, how?

* Lack of confidence at first, bred by the lack of rule comprehension.
* Overwhelmed by the rules, so used a very limited set of them (so 1 step ahead)
* When tried to use more of the rules, lost time in the book.
* Feeling of inadequacy (because of the rules)
* Too much to prepare :
** A full setting without a delimitation (like D&D and its medieval-fantasy base) - although I tried to adapt something Cyberpunk
** Game environments with "actionables" details (and cyberpunk ones have lots of those)
** Player buy-in ideas (world spy agency, action team, etc.)
** Monsters and opposition
* Played through my players, their power fantasies were mine (something that plagues me still, with some games)
* Games were limited, and I don't have much memories of playing a lot. My archives have many notes of setting elements, but so few of characters.

3.  Are there any other things you've done in your life that you feel gives you a better insight into role-playing games in general, than other participants you've know.  How so and in what ways?  Are there things you've done that make it actually harder to DM?

* Honestly, reading The Tao of Dnd and how to DM (and sorry for my bad memory about all this, I'm still rereading some posts to get them)
** Limitations enhancing game
** Deconstructions
** Insights on subject too numerous to be listed
** What to look for in the game and in players
** How to present things
** The importance of a solid base (trade system, useful map, etc.)
** How to manage the game
** Hooks and not investing too much in a scenario, and how a solid base can generate hooks by the score
** Why to let go of my world
** Let the players make their own ways (and give hooks)
** Why obvious things didn't work, etc.
* Mucking around on some forums that are discussion game systems (distant second to Alexis)

4.  In your opinion, are your difficulties or successes different from other DMs?  If you have little or no experience with other DMs, do you still feel that there must be issues that everyone is having? What with the language, the manner in which players respond to rules, your troubles maintaining order and so on?

* I don't remember much from my experience with other DMs, only the most recent ones, and I haven't spoken of our respective difficulties. Still :
** I've a bad memory, which bring a lot of problems (and make learning difficult)
* Concerning issues that I feel are general to most DMs, I don't think there is any. Be it time, players, language, rules, each have his own set of pluses and minuses. But I feel that some issues are more frequent :
** Player motivation and buy-in (or the lack of)
** Availailability of participants and free time.
** Preparation : time, how much, how deep, what to prepare, etc.
** Boredom or burnout with one's campaign or character, especially in this day and age
** ???

5.  Are your players benefiting from your style, or your game?  Is it just a slog ... or does it seem to go easy some nights, or most nights, and once in awhile there is a hiccup?  Do you feel this is a fault that rests with you, or is it an attitude or misunderstanding that the players have?

* Do you think that it is YOU that the players like, or is it the GAME?  Which is their principle motivation. "


6.  How much trouble have you had structuring your campaign?  Does it take a lot of preparation, more than you expected, more than you're really able to give?  Does this leave you scrambling each week?  Do you think time is part of the problem, or is it not knowing for sure what you need to prepare for?

7.  Do you get much resistance when you push the concept of your game, adding elements to the rules or to the setting?  Are there subjects you fear to venture upon?  Are there subjects you've banned from the table?  If so, what are your reasons?

8.  How often do you think about quitting?  If you quit, what do you think you would be losing from that decision?  In forging on, what do you think you are gaining?

* Never thought about quitting
* Gains from forging on :
** Experience
** Occasions to test new things, 

9.  Is it hopeless to try to teach most people the game?  Or do you find that players take to your campaign, or the idea of DMing, rather easily?  Have you spun off a DM from your campaign, one whose world you run in?  If not, do you think this is a rare phenomenon?

10.  If you have quit, why?  Do you miss it?  Do you think about starting it again, or would that be impossible?  If you had the time and the money, do you think there's a possibility you would come back to this game, or is it basically a genie in a memory bottle you'll never recapture?

* Never quit.
